This app is designed to help users find shows in their city happening that day and afterward.
It uses Ticketmaster's API to get information on venues the artists performing and displays that
information.  The user can enter in a city.  It pulls up a list of events.  The user can select on
the venue it will direct the user to google's information on the veune.  The user can select the address 
and have the address opened on google maps.  The user can select the buy tickets button and have them
redirected to Ticketmaster's url for buying tickets.  The app will also display social media and other 
web content on artists that have that information in Ticketmaster's API. 
Eventually, I will add more features to the site as I progress as a developer.
