Helps users such as artists, musicians, and people looking for live music find venues within a city.
Uses songkick's api to get data on venues within a city.
Displays a list of venues with their name, description, location, venue size, and contact.

UPDATE:
Changed the original plan because I never received a key from songkick.
Used ticketmaster's api, but ran into several hurtles with trying to get details on 
the venue information based on a given city.  Decided with the time constraint it would
be better to change the app to be for finding live music events within a certain radius 
of a given city.  When entering in the city it will give a name of the event. The date
of the event.  The artists playing.  Link to buy tickets and a link to get directions
from google maps.
