This app is designed to help users find shows happening in their city that current day and afterward.
It uses Ticketmaster's API to get information on venues the artists performing and displays that
information.  The user can enter in a city.  It pulls up a list of events.  The user can select on
the venue it will send you to google's information on the veune.  The user can select the address and 
have the address opened on google maps.  The user can select the buy tickets button and have them
redirected to Ticketmaster's url for buying tickets for that event.  Eventually will add more to the 
site as I progress through the curriculum.
